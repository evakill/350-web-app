This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This is the web admin site for BullyBye, an anonymous bullying reporting app, created as a CIS350 final project at the University of Pennsylvania. BullyBye allows students to submit accounts of bullying and communicate with school officials anonymously through our platform, eliminating the social stress of speaking out. 

This web application allows adminitrators to view submitted reports and communicate with students via messenger. They can also edit the questions that students respond to when creating a report. 

## How to run
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `node server.js`
Must run this concurrently (open a new tab in terminal) with npm start to begin the server.
